# Maintainer

Reframe is currently maintained by Romuald ([twitter.com/brillout](https://twitter.com/brillout))
who is commited to the project for the years/decades to come.

To expand the project's scope, Reframe is looking for a co-maintainer.
There are a lot of unexplored territories such as automatic deployment
or docs for beginners.

Why should I become a maintainer?
- Because it's fun and interesting.
  <br/>
  Should be the **first and most important reason**.
- Deepens your skills & mindset.
  <br/>
  Reframe likes to push the boundary of what's possible.
  Going deep brings invaluable lessons on many levels.
- Opens new doors.
  <br/>
  Being a maintainer of a widely-used open source project is highly regarded by companies, startups, investors, etc.
  <br/>
  That **should not** be your primary reason.
- Jobs
  <br/>
  Freelance opportunites with agencies doing smallish projects.
  <br/>
  Highly-skilled highly-paid freelance opportunies with agencies doing complex projects for startups.

<br/>
<br/>

# Contribute

- Common sense is the main guideline.
- Before working on a big PR, open an issue so we can discuss your changes before you work on them.
- Opening smallish PRs without prior discussion is fine.
- There is no code style (yet).
