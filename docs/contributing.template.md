# Maintainer

Reframe is currently maintained by Romuald [twitter.com/brillout](https://twitter.com/brillout)
who is commited to the project for the years to come.

To expand the project's scope, Reframe is looking for co-maintainers.

There is a lot of unexplored territory: deployment/CI, databases/ORM, docs for beginners, CMS, etc.

Why should I become a maintainer?

 - Because it's fun
   <br/>
   Should be the first and most important reason.
 - Deepens your skills & mindset
   <br/>
   Reframe likes to push the boundary of what's possible with an ejectable, universal, webassembly, full-stack framework.
 - Opens new doors
   <br/>
   Being a maintainer of a widely-used open source project is highly regarded by companies, startups, investors, etc.
 - Jobs: Cooperations with web dev agencies.
   <br/>
   Junior-dev freelance opportunites with agencies that do small projects.
   <br/>
   High-skilled-dev high-paid freelance opportunies with agencies doing big projects for startups.
   <br/>
   Have a 30h-50h work week where 50%-80% is Reframe dev and 20%-50% is agency dev.

The important thing is that you commit long term.
It doesn't matter whether you're junior or senior dev.
