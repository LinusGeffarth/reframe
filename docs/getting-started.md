5. Read the entire [Usage Basics](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#react-frontend) section of the react-frontend starter.

##### Other starters

The [react-frontend starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#readme) is the recommanded starter for your first Reframe app.
It will scaffold a frontend-only stack.
(Aka static site: An app that consists of static browser assets only and no Node.js is required.)

But if you already know for sure that you need a Node.js server then checkout the [react-app starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-app#readme).
(If you are not sure then use the react-frontend starter: You can easily add a Node.js server afterwards.)

See the [list of starters](/docs/starters.md#readme) for more starters.
