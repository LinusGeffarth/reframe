5. Read the entire [Usage Basics](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#react-frontend) section of the react-frontend starter.

##### Other starters

The [react-frontend starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#readme) is the recommended starter for your first Reframe app.
It will scaffold a frontend-only (aka static site).

But if you need a Node.js server then use the [react-app starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-app#readme) instead.

And if you don't know whether you need a Node.js server, then we still recommend to start with a frontend-only as you can easily add a Node.js server afterwards.

See the [list of starters](/docs/starters.md#readme) for more starters.
