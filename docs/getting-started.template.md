In this getting started
we start writing an HTML-static and DOM-static hello world example and we progresivelly change the example to make it HTML-dynamic and DOM-dynamic.

Let's revisit the HTML-static and DOM-static hello world page of the introduction.

#### HTML-static & DOM-static

A hello world page definition:

~~~js
!INLINE ../example/pages/HelloPage.html.js
~~~

Upon running the `reframe` CLI a Node.js/hapi server serving our page is created:

~~~shell
$ npm install -g @reframe/cli
~~~

~~~shell
$ reframe
✔ Page directory found at /home/alice/code/my-project/reframe-example/pages
✔ Frontend built at /home/alice/code/my-project/reframe-example/pages/dist/browser/
✔ Server running at http://localhost:3000
~~~

As shown at view-source:http://localhost:3000/hello the HTML of our page is:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello there</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A Hello World page created with Reframe.">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="react-root"><div>Hello World</div></div>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

Because of `htmlIsStatic: true` Reframe will build the HTML on build-time, thus the page's HTML is static.
We don't load any JavaScript and the DOM is static as well.

Now let's consider a more dynamic example where we display the current date.

#### HTML-dynamic & DOM-static

We display the current date
and we also display a timestamp so we can see when the page has been generated.

~~~js
!INLINE ../example/pages/DatePage.html.js
~~~

If the current time would be 1/1/2018 1:37 PM then the HTML code would be

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Current Date</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="react-root">
            <div>Date: Mon Jan 01 2018</div>
            <small>(Generated at 13:37:00)</small>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

Reloading the page 1 second later at 1:38 PM would lead to the same HTML but with `(Generated at 13:38:00)` instead of `(Generated at 13:37:00)`;
This means that the HTML is rerendered on every request, thus the page's HTML is dynamic.

We still don't load any JavaScript and the page's DOM is static.
Let's now load some JavaScript to update the DOM every second in order to always show the current time.

#### HTML-dynamic & DOM-dynamic

Note that all previous filenames endeded with `.html.js`: `HelloPage.html.js`, `DatePage.html.js`, and `TimePage.html.js`.

This time we save our page object in a filename ending with `.universal.js`: `TimePage.universal.js`.
This is how we tell Reframe to render the view on the browser. (Reframe will then call `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.)

~~~js
!INLINE ../example/pages/TimePage.universal.js
~~~

And the HTML code of view-source:http://localhost:3000/hello is:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Current Time</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="react-root"><div>Time: 13:38:00</div></div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="/commons.hash_cef317062944dce98c01.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="/TimePage.entry.hash_972c7f760528baca032a.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

As the HTML code shows we load JavaScript code.
The JavaScript code (that bundles React and `TimeComponent`) mounts a `<TimeComponent/>` element onto the DOM.
The mounted `<TimeComponent/>` then updates the DOM every second and the current time is continuously updated.

When Reframe sees a `.universal.js` file in the `pages` directory it will generate JavaScript code that acs as an entry point for the browser.
You can see generated entry point source code at `~/code/@reframe/example/pages/dist/browser/source/TimePage.entry.js`.

The entry point generated by Reframe includes the whole .universal.js and the whole view is loaded to the browser.
This is fine if you the view of the whole page isn't too KB heavy or if the whole page needs to by hydrated anyways.
But you can also choose to hydrate only a small part of your page so that you don't have to load the entire page view logic onto the browser. We call this "partial DOM-dynamic" and we'll see how to that in a bit. Before that let's see how to create the browser entry point yourself.

You can also create the JavaScript browser entry point yourself.
