Check the [list of plugins](/docs/plugins.md) for a plugin that integrates the server framework you want to use with Reframe.
You can then get control over the server instance by runnning `$ reframe eject server`.

If there isn't a plugin for the server framework you want, then run
- `$ reframe eject server`
- `$ reframe eject server-integration`
to get full control over the integration of the current server framework and Reframe.
At that point you can get rid of the current server framework and replace it any other server framework.
