Check the [list of plugins](/docs/plugins.md) for a plugin integrating the server framework you want to use.
You can then get control over the server instance by runnning `$ reframe eject server`.

If there isn't a plugin for the server framework you want, then run
`$ reframe eject server`
to get control over the server.
At that point you can get rid of the current server framework and replace it another server framework.
