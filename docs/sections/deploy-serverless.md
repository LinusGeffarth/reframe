If your app is stateless then we recommand serverless deployment.

Serverless deployment solutions:
 - [Up](https://github.com/apex/up) - CLI tool to manage serverless deployement on AWS.

   The free tier is generous and will likely be enough for your first prototype.

   The free tier doesn't support custom domains. (See [zeit.co/pricing](https://zeit.co/pricing).)
