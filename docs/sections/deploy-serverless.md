If your app is stateless we then recommand serverless deployment.

Serverless deployment solutions:
 - [Up](https://github.com/apex/up) - CLI tool to manage serverless deployement on AWS.
 - [Now](https://zeit.co/now) - Serverless host.

A step-by-step guide on how to deploy a Reframe app on Up can be found [here](https://github.com/AurelienLourot/reframe-on-up).

If you want to persist data, you may consider using a cloud database.
