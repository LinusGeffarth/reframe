The deploy command works with any static host that integrates with Git such as
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (recommanded) or
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you want to manually deploy then simply copy/serve the `dist/browser/` directory.
This directory contains all browser assets.
