A CSS file can be loaded and applied by importing it.

~~~js
import './GlitterStyle.css';
~~~

Static assets (images, fonts, videos, etc.) can be imported as well
but importing an asset doesn't actually load it:
Only the URL of the asset is returned.
It is up to us to use/fetch the URL of the asset.

~~~js
import diamondUrl from './diamond.png';

// do something with diamondUrl, e.g. `await fetch(diamondUrl)` or `<img src={diamondUrl}/>`
~~~

In addition, static assets can be referenced in CSS by using the `url` data type.

~~~css
.diamond-background {
    background-image: url('./diamond.png');
}
~~~

Example of a page using CSS, fonts, images and other static assets:
 - [/examples/basics/pages/glitter/](/examples/basics/pages/glitter/)
