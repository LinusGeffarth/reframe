# Starters

- [react-frontend](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#readme)
- [react-app](/plugins/create/starters/react-app#readme)
- [react-fullstack-app](/plugins/create/starters/react-fullstack-app#readme) (Work-in-progress)

They scaffold the following:

&nbsp; | react-frontend | react-app | react-fullstack-app
--- | :---: | :---: | :---:
React Frontend | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Node.js Server | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Database/ORM | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark:

Don't bother choosing the right starter:
You can easily add/remove a Node.js server and add/remove a database/ORM afterwards.
Instead, quickly choose a starter and start write your prototype.
As your prototype grows add/remove what you need.
