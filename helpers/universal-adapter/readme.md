# `@universal-adapter`

`@universal-adapter` packages are about finding the common denominator for libraries that do similar things.

Allowing library authors to develop against a single abstraction instead of n different library APIs.

Allowing you to integrate with several server frameworks at once.

 - Express adapter: `@universal-adapter/express`
 - Hapi adapter: `@universal-adapter/hapi`
 - Koa adapter: `@universal-adapter/koa`
