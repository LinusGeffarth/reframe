### FAQ

Isn't the same than writing one endpoint? Why do I need wildcard api?

Isn't the point of creating an API to have a generic public interface?

Isn't Wildcard API just a RESTful API with a single endpoint?

Should I create my API with Wildcard API, RESTful, or GraphQL?

Doesn't it mean that the server needs to be deployed more often?
