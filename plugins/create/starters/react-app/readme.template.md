# react-app

Starter to create an app with:
 - Frontend (React)
 - Server (Node.js + [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi))

Same than
[react-sql](/plugins/create/starters/react-sql#readme)
but without database/ORM.

You can use this starter if you want a different tech stack than react-sql's one,
if you want SSR and you already have a backend,
or if your app doesn't need a database.

You can:
 - Add a database + ORM + API
 - Remove the Node.js server afterwards (turning your app to a static site)
 - Use another server framework such as Express, Koa, etc.

See [Usage Manual](/docs/usage-manual.md#readme).
