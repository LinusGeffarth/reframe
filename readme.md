A web framework with a new approach:
Reframe is merely a collection of do-one-thing-do-it-well tools.

With Reframe,
you own your stack,
you keep your freedom.

We enable you to
develop
with the same guidance and
as quickly as with classical frameworks
while being able to replace rapid-prototyping tools
with entreprise-grade tools as you scale.

&nbsp;

:hammer_and_wrench: **Tools**

Do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are the building blocks of Reframe.
We use React, Node.js, and develop our own:

- [Goldpage](https://github.com/reframejs/goldpage) -
  Page Builder &mdash;
  create a modern frontend.
- [Wildcard API](https://github.com/reframejs/wildcard-api) -
  JavaScript Functions as API &mdash;
  create an API between the browser and Node.js.
- [ProtoDB](https://github.com/brillout/proto-db) -
  A simple filesystem-based database for prototypes and small to medium-sized apps.
- **Auto-Deploy** -
  We are curently researching fully automatic deployments.
  [Work-in-progress]

Each of our tools can be used individually and independently of each other.

For a quick start, use our stack as it is.

But
if you need customization
you can replace our stack's tool.
For example,
if your company is experienced with Vue,
you can use our stack with Vue instead of React.

In short,
because our tools are independent of each other,
you fully keep your freedom.

&nbsp;

:rocket: **Starters**

Our starters assemble state-of-the-art tools into well-polished scaffolds.
We design our starters to be simple and to include only what you need to build an MVP as quickly as possible.

- [Reframe Full Stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack) -
  Frontend (React, Goldpage) + Backend (Node.js, Hapi) + API (Wildcard)
- [Reframe Frontend](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend) -
  Frontend (React, Goldpage)

Start building your app today,
deliver your first prototype tomorrow,
and progressively adopt entreprise-grade tools as you scale.

&nbsp;

:crystal_ball: **Future-Proof**

In the Node.js ecosystem, big monoliths don't survive.
Node.js is a rapidly evolving ecosystem while
big monoliths have shown difficulties adopting new technologies.

Instead of being a big monolith,
Reframe is based on do-one-thing-do-it-well tools.
This fundamentally different approach
enables Reframe to adopt the technologies of tomorrow and
enables you to replace technologies as you scale.

In short, Reframe has no lock-in, in the broadest sense.
We call this approach the [Zero-LOC framework](/zero-loc-framework.md).
