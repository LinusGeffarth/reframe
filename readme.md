&nbsp;

Framework to create web apps.

Designed for high development speed with no sacrifice on flexibility.

Assembles a JavaScript stack with integrations for:
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; Node.js servers (Express, Koa, Hapi, ...)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; Modern frontend (React, Vue.js, React Native Web, ...)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; Utils (TypeScript, React Router, PostCSS, ...)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; [WIP] Node.js ORMs (TypeORM & more to come)

All stacks are supported:
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend + backend + database/ORM (aka full-stack) [WIP]
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend + backend (aka SSR)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend-only (aka static site)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; backend-only (aka old-school app with plain old HTML)

<img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/welcome.png?sanitize=true' align="left"/>
</a>
That's it:
We simply define a React component and a so-called page config.
No build configuration.
(But if you want to, you can configure and take control over everything.)

### Why Reframe

There are many web frameworks out there with huge adoption, including Ruby on Rails, Django and Next.js.
So why do we need another one?
The main reasons are around flexibility.

Web frameworks have a bad reputation regarding flexibility.
There is a general belief that there is a trade off between development speed and flexibility
and that a web framework always comes with a lost in flexibility.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way.

Reframe is designed from the ground up to be entirely flexible.
We would even argue that Reframe is more flexible than gluying do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries yourself.

Reframe's flexibility is based on three pillars:

1. **Progressive Eject** -
   All Reframe parts are ejectable:
   You can eject the build configuration (the webpack config), and/or the render code, and/or the routing code, and/or the server code, etc.

2. **Minimal glue code** -
   We isolate a maximum of code in do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.
   That way, we manage to keep glue code to a tiny ~500 lines of code.

3. **Flexible stack** -
   You can easily and at any time
   remove/add a frontend, backend, or database/ORM to your app.
   For example, you can start with a frontend-only (static site) and later add a Node.js server to it.

Benefits of that flexibility:

**Take Over Control** -
You can progressively eject and take control over Reframe parts
as your app grows and the need arises.
All Reframe parts are ejectable which means that you can gain full control.

**Removable** -
If you eject all Reframe parts then you effectively get rid of Reframe.
At that point your code doesn't depend on Reframe anymore and only depends on do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
(such as React, Express, Webpack, etc.).

**Rapid Prototyping** -
You can change your app's stack at any time.
This comes in handy for rapid prototyping.
For example,
you can implement a first prototype as a frontend-only
while skipping a real database by hard-writing data in the codebase.
You can then easily deploy your first prototype.
(E.g. to a free static host such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.)
Later, when hard-writing data isn't sustainable anymore,
you can add a Node.js server and a database to your prototype.

**Learn Once, Write Any App** -
Instead of learning several frameworks,
learn Reframe to be able to implement apps with any JavaScript stack.
For example, you can implement a frontend-only with Vue.js
but you can as well implement a frontend+backend with React.

**Resillient Framework** -
Web dev technologies are rapidly evolving and,
thanks to its flexible architecture,
Reframe is able to adapt and embrace what comes next.

### Examples

- [Frontend](#frontend)
- [Full-stack](#full-stack)

###### Frontend

We define a page config `HelloPage`:

~~~jsx
// ~/my-app/pages/HelloPage.config.js

// By default you write your views with React.
// You can use another view library such as Vue.
import React from 'react';

const HelloPage = {
  route: '/hello/:name', // Parameterized route
  title: 'Hi there', // Page's <title>
  view: props => {
    // The route argument `name` is available at `props.route.args`
    const name = props.route.args.name;
    return (
      <div>Hello {name}</div>
    );
  }
};

export default HelloPage;
~~~

    <img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/hello.png?sanitize=true' width="780" style="max-width:100%;"/>
</p>

And that's it,
we created a frontend simply by defining one page config.

###### Full-stack

Let's look at a Todo App.
(Note that the database/ORM integration shown here is work-in-progress.)

~~~ts
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Todo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @Column()
    isCompleted: boolean;

    @ManyToOne("User")
    author: "User";
}
~~~

To make our `Todo` entries accessible from our views, we define permissions:

~~~js
// Only the author of a todo item should be allowed to read & write
const isTodoAuthor = ({loggedUser, object: todo}) => loggedUser && loggedUser.id===todo.author.id;

const permissions = [
    {
        modelName: 'Todo',
        write: isTodoAuthor,
        read: isTodoAuthor,
    },
];
~~~

We can now access `Todo` entries from our view:

~~~js
import React from 'react';
import easyqlClient from '@easyql/client';

const TodoList = ({todos}) => (
    <div>{ todos.map(todo =>
        <div key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</div>
    )}</div>
);

const getInitialProps = async ({req}) => {
    const loggedUser = easyqlClient.getLoggedUser({req});
    const query = {
        queryType: 'read',
        modelName: 'Todo',
        filter: {
            author: {
                id: loggedUser.id,
            },
        },
    };
    const response = await easyqlClient.query({query, req});
    const todos = response.objects;
    return {todos};
};

export default {
    route: '/',
    view: TodoList,
    getInitialProps,
};
~~~

And that's it,
we simply defined pages, data models, and permissions to create a full-stack app.

### Quick Start

1. Install the Reframe CLI.
   ~~~shell
   $ npm install -g @reframe/cli
   ~~~
   Alternatively with yarn:
   ~~~shell
   $ yarn global add @reframe/cli
   ~~~

2. Create a new Reframe app.
   ~~~shell
   $ reframe create react-frontend
   ~~~
   A `my-react-frontend/` directory is created and populated with the react-frontend starter.

3. Build and serve the app.
   ~~~shell
   $ cd my-frontend-app/
   $ reframe dev
   ~~~

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. Read the entire [Usage Basics](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#react-frontend) section of the react-frontend starter.

##### Other starters

The [react-frontend starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-frontend#readme) is the recommended starter for your first Reframe app.
It will scaffold a frontend-only (aka static site).

But if you need a Node.js server then use the [react-app starter](/plugins/create/starters/react-app#readme) instead.

And if you don't know whether you need a Node.js server, then we still recommend to start with a frontend-only as you can easily add a Node.js server afterwards.

See the [list of starters](/docs/starters.md#readme) for more starters.
