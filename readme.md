## What is Reframe

Reframe allows you to quickly create web apps with:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Interactive views (with React, Vue, ...)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Server (with Node.js and Hapi, Koa, Express, ...)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Database & ORM (with Objection.js, Prisma, ...)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
API (with [Wildcard](https://github.com/reframejs/wildcard-api))
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
SSR (with [SSR Coin](https://github.com/reframejs/ssr-coin))
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
WIP: Automatic deployment & Admin panel

Reframe is a *0-LOC framework*: it has no source code and [github.com/reframejs](https://github.com/reframejs) is merely a collection of:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries, and
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
starters that assembles these libraries into a ready-to-use boilerplate to quickly get started.

Reframe allows you to develop as quickly as other frameworks,
such as Ruby on Rails or Django,
but with a fundamental increase in freedom and robustness.

<br/>

## Getting Started

Choose a starter to get started: [github.com/topics/reframe-starter](https://github.com/topics/reframe-starter).

(There is only one starter for now but expect more starters soon.)

<br/>

## 0-LOC Framework

Reframe consists only of:
- **Libraries** -
  Each library is a do-one-thing-do-it-well library:
  it takes care of one thing and one thing only.
  It can be used independently of Reframe and independently of other libraries.
- **Starters** -
  A starter assembles libraries into a well-polished and ready-to-use scaffold (aka boilerplate) for you to quickly get started.

We call Reframe a *0-LOC framework*: a framework that has no source code but is only a collection of libraries and starters.

For more freedom:

- **Cherry pick libraries** -
  Each library can be used individually and independently of other libraries. You can choose which libraries you want to use.
- **No lock-in** -
  Reframe is merely a collection of libraries and starters &mdash; there is virtually no lock-in.

For more robustness:

- **Robust libraries** -
  Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
  often survive a long time resulting into hardened and rock-solid tools.

- **Robust framework** -
  Being based on robust libraries is not only a robust foundation but also a flexible and future-proof one:
  Reframe libraries can easily be used with the tools of tomorrow.

- **Framework collaboration** -
  We hope our fellow framework authors to follow the 0-LOC philosophy and
  we envision a future where frameworks share many libraries for a more vibrant and robust JavaScript ecosystem.
