### Introduction

Reframe is a framework to create web apps.
It is born out of the belief that a web framework can be rapid yet, as the same time, flexible.

Reframe assembles a JavaScript stack that can integrate with
Node.js, React, React Native Web, React Router, Vue.js, TypeScript, TypeORM, PostCSS, Webpack, Express, Koa, Hapi, etc.

<br/>

**Rapid**

You can create a web app by defining so-called "page configs".
Reframe takes care of the rest:
It automatically transpiles, bundles, routes, renders, and serves your pages.

<p align="center">
    <img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/welcome.png?sanitize=true'/>
</p>

That's it, we created a web app simply by defining one React component and one page config.

Yet, Reframe is designed to be highly flexible.

<br/>

**Flexible**

Web frameworks have a bad reputation regarding flexibility.
There is a general belief that there is a trade off between rapidness and flexibility
and that a web framework always comes with a lost in flexibility.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way.

Reframe greatly cares about flexiblity
and is (to our knowledge) the most flexible web framework out there.
We would even argue that Reframe is more flexible than gluying do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries yourself.

Reframe's flexibility is based on three pillars:

1. **Progressive Eject** -
   All Reframe parts are ejectable:
   You can eject the build configuration, and/or the render code, and/or the routing code, and/or the server code, etc.

2. **Minimal glue code** -
   We isolate a maximum of code in do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.
   That way, we managed to reduce the glue code to a tiny ~500 lines of code.

3. **Flexible stack** -
   Reframe assembles a flexible stack:
   You can configure your app to have a frontend only (aka static site), a frontend + backend (aka SSR app), a backend only (aka old-school app with plain old HTML), or a frontend + backend + database/ORM (aka full-stack app).
   And it is easy to add/remove a backend, and/or a frontend, and/or a database/ORM to an existing app.
 
Giving us some benefits:

**Take Over Control** - 
As your app grows and the need arises you can eject and take control over Reframe parts.
All Reframe parts are ejectable which means that you can gain full control.

**Easily Removable** - 
If you eject all Reframe parts then you effectively get rid of Reframe.
Your code then doesn't depend on Reframe anymore but only on do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.

**Rapid Prototyping** -
You can change your app's stack at any point in time, which comes in handy for quick prototyping.
For example,
you can have your first prototype to be a frontend only (static site)
that can easily be deployed (to a static host such as Netlify or GitHub Pages).
You would skip a database by hard-writing the data in your code base.
Then, you would add a server and a real database at a later point when hard-writing data isn't sustainable anymore.

**Learn Once, Write Any App** -
Instead of learning different frameworks for different types of JavaScript stacks,
you can learn Reframe to be able to implement apps with all kinds of JavaScript stacks.

### Examples

- [Frontend](#frontend)
- [Full-stack](#full-stack)

###### Frontend

We define a page config `HelloPage`:

~~~jsx
// ~/my-app/pages/HelloPage.config.js

// By default you write your views with React.
// You can use another view library such as Vue.
import React from 'react';

const HelloPage = {
  route: '/hello/:name', // Parameterized route
  title: 'Hi there', // Page's <title>
  view: props => {
    // The route argument `name` is available at `props.route.args`
    const name = props.route.args.name;
    return (
      <div>Hello {name}</div>
    );
  }
};

export default HelloPage;
~~~

<p align="center">
    <img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/hello.png?sanitize=true' width="780" style="max-width:100%;"/>
</p>

And that's it,
we created a frontend simply by defining one page config.

###### Full-stack

Let's look at a Todo App.
(Note that the database/ORM integration shown here is work-in-progress.)

~~~ts
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Todo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @Column()
    isCompleted: boolean;

    @ManyToOne("User")
    author: "User";
}
~~~

To make our `Todo` entries accessible from our views, we define permissions:

~~~js
// Only the author of a todo item should be allowed to read & write
const isTodoAuthor = ({loggedUser, object: todo}) => loggedUser && loggedUser.id===todo.author.id;

const permissions = [
    {
        modelName: 'Todo',
        write: isTodoAuthor,
        read: isTodoAuthor,
    },
];
~~~

We can now access `Todo` entries from our view:

~~~js
import React from 'react';
import easyqlClient from '@easyql/client';

const TodoList = ({todos}) => (
    <div>{ todos.map(todo =>
        <div key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</div>
    )}</div>
);

const getInitialProps = async ({req}) => {
    const loggedUser = easyqlClient.getLoggedUser({req});
    const query = {
        queryType: 'read',
        modelName: 'Todo',
        filter: {
            author: {
                id: loggedUser.id,
            },
        },
    };
    const response = await easyqlClient.query({query, req});
    const todos = response.objects;
    return {todos};
};

export default {
    route: '/',
    view: TodoList,
    getInitialProps,
};
~~~

And that's it,
we simply defined pages, data models, and permissions to create a full-stack app.

### Getting Started

Choose a starter:

- [React Server](/docs/react-server-starter.md)
- [React Frontend](/docs/react-frontend-starter.md)
- [React Database](/docs/react-database-starter.md) (Work-in-progress)

They scaffold the following:

&nbsp; | React Frontend | React Server | React Database
--- | :---: | :---: | :---:
React Frontend | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Node.js Server | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Database/ORM | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark:

Don't bother choosing the right starter:
You can easily add/remove a Node.js server and add/remove a database/ORM afterwards.
Instead, quickly choose a starter and start write your prototype.
As your prototype grows add/remove what you need.
