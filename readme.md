## What is Reframe

Reframe is a framework to quickly create web apps.

Reframe is a *Zero-LOC framework*:
it has no source code &mdash;
instead,
it is merely a collection of libraries and starters:

Starters:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[reframe-full-stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack): :rocket: Starter to create a full-stack app: Interactive Frontend (React) + SSR (ssr-coin) + Node.js Server (Hapi) + API (Wildcard).
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[reframe-static-website](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-static-website): :rocket: Starter to create a static website: Interactive Frontend (React) + SSR (ssr-coin).

A starter allows you to quickly scaffold a ready-to-use app on top of do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries such as React, or ssr-coin.

Libraries:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[ssr-coin](https://github.com/reframejs/ssr-coin) - Quickly & easily add SSR to your app.
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[Wildcard](https://github.com/reframejs/wildcard-api) - JvaScript Functions as API &mdash; Quickly and easily create an API using JavaScript functions.

Both ssr-coin and Wildcard can be used individually, independently of each other, and with any view library (React, Vue, RNW, ...), any server framework (Express, Koa, Hapi, ...), etc.

A Zero-LOC framework allows you to develop as quickly as monolithic frameworks
(Next.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, ...)
but with a fundamental increase in freedom and robustness.

Reframe's vision is to develop a Zero-LOC framework that is as feature-rich as Ruby on Rails but following the Zero-LOC philosophy.
Sounds interesting to you? [We are looking for co-maintainers](/contributing.md)!

## Getting Started

Choose an official starter:
- [reframe-full-stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack) - If you want an interactive frontend + Node.js server.
- [reframe-static-website](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-static-website) - If you want a interactive frontend withouth a Node.js server. E.g. if you don't need a server (a blog, a homepage, ...) or if you already have one (e.g. you already have a Java backend).

Or choose a community starter: [github.com/topics/reframe-starter](https://github.com/topics/reframe-starter).

## Zero-LOC

Reframe consists only of:
- **Libraries** -
  Each library is a do-one-thing-do-it-well library:
  it takes care of one thing and one thing only.
  It can be used independently of Reframe and independently of other libraries.
- **Starters** -
  A starter assembles libraries into a well-polished scaffold (aka boilerplate) for you to quickly get started.

We call this a *Zero-LOC framework*: a framework that has no source code but is only a collection of libraries and starters.

For more freedom.

- **Cherry pick libraries** -
  Each library can be used individually and independently of other libraries. You can choose which libraries you want to use.
- **No lock-in** -
  Reframe is merely a collection of libraries and starters &mdash; there is virtually no lock-in.

For more robustness.

- **Robust libraries** -
  Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
  often survive a long time resulting into hardened and rock-solid tools.

- **Robust framework** -
  Being based on robust libraries is not only a robust foundation but also a flexible and future-proof one:
  Reframe libraries can easily be used with the tools of tomorrow.

- **Framework collaboration** -
  We hope our fellow framework authors to follow the Zero-LOC philosophy and
  we envision a future where frameworks share many libraries for a more vibrant and robust JavaScript ecosystem.
