## What is Reframe

Reframe is a collection of tools to quickly build a modern & simple stacks.

Our stacks are simple &mdash;
we inlcude the bare minium of tools so you can get started quickly.
We believe you should add tools as you go and as the need arises.

:o: Libraries

Our libraries
are the building blocks of Reframe.
Each of our library can be used individually and independently of each other and independently of Reframe.

- [Goldpage]() - Page Builder &mdash; to easily create a modern frontend. Works with any view library.
  Works with any view library (React, Vue, RNW, ...).
  Supports all app types (so-called "SPA", "MPA", "SSR", "static website", ...).
  (so-called "SPA", "MPA", "SSR", "static website", ...).
- [Wildcard]() - JavaScript Functions as API &mdash; Simple way to create an API between your frontend and your Node.js server.

:rocket: Starters

Our starters assemble libraries into a well-polished scaffoled (aka boilerplate) for you to quickly get started.

are an opinionated curatation of tools.

Start

We believe in starting with only a minimal amount of tools small and finish big.

Our starters focus of getting started as quickly as possible
while you giving you the freedom to scale from a 1
to a billion dollar company.

:books: Learning Material

Our library and starter documentation is frontend beginner friendly.
We only assume a Software Engineering background.
For example, if you are a backend developer wanting to get into frontend, then you can start with Reframe.

We guide you about when to use what tool
and help you decided whether to use TypeScript, Redux, GraphQL, automated tests, etc.

:milky_way: The Future

Reframe
exclusively uses independent do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.

This approach, which we call *Zero-LOC*, brings fundamental improvements in terms of robustness, flexibility, and freedom.
We believe it to be the future of web frameworks.
We explain what Zero-LOC is about and its benefits at [Zero-LOC](/zero-loc.md).

## Getting Started

Our starters allow you to quickly get up and running:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[reframe-full-stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack) -
Frontend (React) + Backend (Node.js, Hapi) + API (Wildcard) + SSR (ssr-coin).
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
[reframe-frontend](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend) -
Frontend (React) + Static Rendering (ssr-coin).

We recommend the
[reframe-full-stack starter](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack)
if you need a server and the
[reframe-frontend starter](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend)
otherwise.
For example:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
Your app doesn't require a server (a blog, a homepage, ...) &#8658; [reframe-frontend](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend).
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
You already have a server (a Firebase backend, a Java backend, ...)  &#8658; [reframe-frontend](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend).
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
You want a Node.js server with a database &#8658; [reframe-full-stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack).
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;
You need SSR &#8658; [reframe-full-stack](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-full-stack).

You can use [a community starter](https://github.com/topics/reframe-starter)
for alternative stacks
or you can assemble our libraries into a custom stack yourself.
(Our libraries can be used individually and independently of Reframe.)
