# Reframe

Reframe allows you to **create web apps** with following starters:
 - [Reframe Objection]() - Create a SQL-centric app with database, API, and interactive views.
 - [Reframe Prisma]() - Create an ORM-centric app with database, API, and interactive views.
 - [Reframe Static Website]() - Create a static website with modern technologies.

Reframe is what we call a *0-LOC framework*:
this repository has no source code
and
the [github.com/reframejs](https://github.com/reframejs) organisation is merely a collection of:
 - **Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.**
   Each libary can be used independently of each other.
 - **Starters.**
   If you are not sure were to start, then the Reframe starters are here for you.
   If you already have an existic code base, you can cherry pick instead.

The benefits of such architecture are plenty:

**Freedom** -
 - You have full freedom:
You can cherry pick the do-one-thing-well libraries you want.
 - No lock-in:
   You can
 - Removable: Moving away from Reframe is only a matter of replacing do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries with other or with and you can do so progressively, one do-one-thing-well library at a time.

**Robust tools** -
Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries tend to be more robust than frameworks:
they usually compete with many other libraries that do the same thing
and they can survive a very long time resulting a hardened rock-solid tool.

**Robust framework** -
the day all the do-one-thing-well libraries we developed are replaced with
better libraries that do the same thing.
At that point

Fundammentally more robust architecture:
only do-one-thing-well libraries can be replaced with.
Reframe will become obsolete the day all do-one-thing-well we developed get .
But what's for sure: Monolithic frameworks are dead and 0-LOC frameworks are the future.
Everyone is happy :-).
If a new view library (we are evaluating Svelte btw.)
We can't wait to share do-one-thing-well libraries with other 0-LOC frameworks.
We forsee that Reframe will not be the only which is a good thing!
We want 
Resillient
 - Cooperation.
This makes each and ultimatively a more robust fundation for developing web apps.
and have a 
with and have 

libraries survive longer than frameworks and more robust.
If becomes obsolete and weak,
Reframe 
Eventually Reframe will be composed of only standard do-one-thing-do-it-well.
- harden 
over time we expect a better developer experience than monolithic frameworks.
- Future proof.
well-polished starters that assemble with well-polished developer experience


Reframe features:
- Interactive views (with React, Vue, ...)
- SSR (with [SSR Coin]())
- Node.js Server (with Hapi, Koa, Express, ...)
- RPC-like API
- Database & ORMs (with Objection.js, Prisma, ...)

We are exploring following areas:
- Admin panel - [WIP ticket #1]()
- CMS - [WIP ticket #3]()
- Automatic deployment - [WIP ticket #9]()
