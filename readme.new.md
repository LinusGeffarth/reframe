# Reframe

Reframe allows you to **create web apps**, such as:
 -  - Create a
 - SQL-centric app with database, API, and interactive views (with the starter [Reframe Objection]())
 - [Reframe Prisma]() - Create An ORM-centric app with database, API, and interactive views (with the
 - [Reframe Static Website]() - A static website with modern technologies (with the)

Features:
- Interactive views (with React, Vue, ...)
- Old-school backends with non-interactive dynamic HTML (with React/Vue/... as HTML template engine)
- Node.js Server (with Hapi, Koa, Express, ...)
- Database & ORM (with Objection.js, Prisma, ...)
- RPC-like API (with [Wildcard]())
- SSR (with [SSR Coin]())

Work-in-progress:
- Automatic deployment - [WIP ticket #9]()
- Admin panel - [WIP ticket #1]()
- CMS - [WIP ticket #3]()

Reframe is what we call a *0-LOC framework*:
this repository has no source code
and [github.com/reframejs](https://github.com/reframejs) is merely a collection of:
 - **Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.**
   Each libary takes care of one problem and one problem only and can be used independently of other Reframe libraries.
 - **Starters.**
   A starter assembles libraries into a well-polished scaffold so you can quickly get started (aka boilerplate).
   Starters aim to be as easy to use and as feature-rich as monolithic frameworks (Django, Rails, ...).

The benefits are plenty:

**Freedom** -
You are entirely free to cherry pick as few, as many, and any do-one-thing-do-it-well library you want.
For example, among all Reframe libraries, you can choose to use only [Wildcard API](),
or you can choose a Reframe starter but with another ORM.
There is no lock-in;
you can replace any do-one-thing-well library with another one, or with your custom implementation.
For example you can use a Reframe starter and later replace React with the next cool thing (yes, we are [evaluating Svlete]() ;-)).
Or you can start using Reframe's auto-deploy library and later replace it with your custom deploy strategy.

**Robust tools** -
Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries tend to be more robust than frameworks.
They usually compete with many libraries that do the same thing
and they can survive a very long time resulting a hardened rock-solid tool.

**Robust framework** -
All do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries work independently of each other which makes things future proof.
For example, a new view library comes and makes React obsolete?
That's cool and you'll be able to use this new view library since all Reframe libraries work with any view library.

- **Collaboration**
All do-one-thing libraries we wrote can be used independently and even within a framework other than Reframe.
We hope that competing framework will follow the 0-LOC philosophy and we envision a future were Reframe uses
the library of other 0-LOC framework authors and vice-versa.

and we.
So that we collaborate instead of unecessary competing.

the day all the do-one-thing-well libraries we developed are replaced with
better libraries that do the same thing.
At that point

Fundammentally more robust architecture:
only do-one-thing-well libraries can be replaced with.
Reframe will become obsolete the day all do-one-thing-well we developed get .
But what's for sure: Monolithic frameworks are dead and 0-LOC frameworks are the future.
Everyone is happy :-).
If a new view library (we are evaluating Svelte btw.)
We can't wait to share do-one-thing-well libraries with other 0-LOC frameworks.
We forsee that Reframe will not be the only which is a good thing!
We want 
Resillient
 - Cooperation.
This makes each and ultimatively a more robust fundation for developing web apps.
and have a 
with and have 

libraries survive longer than frameworks and more robust.
If becomes obsolete and weak,
Reframe 
Eventually Reframe will be composed of only standard do-one-thing-do-it-well.
- harden 
over time we expect a better developer experience than monolithic frameworks.
- Future proof.
well-polished starters that assemble with well-polished developer experience


We also have [couple]() of [crazy]() ideas ;-).
