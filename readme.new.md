# Reframe

With Reframe, you can develop

This repository has no source code.
Instead,
The [github.com/reframejs](https://github.com/reframejs) organisation is merely a collection of:
 - **Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.**
   Each libary can be used independently of each other.
 - **Starters.**
   If you are not sure were to start, then the Reframe starters are here for you.
   If you already have an existic code base, you can cherry pick instead.

The benefits of such architecture are plenty:

**Freedom** -
No more framework lock-in:
You can cherry pick the do-one-thing-do-it-well libaries and you can use as little and as much of Reframe.
And no more huge refactors: Moving away from Reframe is only a matter of progressively replacing do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries

**Robust tools** -
Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries survive longer than frameworks and more robust.
If becomes obsolete and weak,
Reframe 
Eventually Reframe will be composed of only standard do-one-thing-do-it-well.
- harden 
over time we expect a better developer experience than monolithic frameworks.
- Future proof.

**Robust framework** -
fundammentally more robust architecutre
We forsee that Reframe will not be the only which is a good thing!
We want 
Resillient
 - Cooperation.
   E.g. Meteor
This makes each and ultimatively a more robust fundation for developing web apps.

Currently, Reframe has three starters:

- ORM-centric full-stack app

- SQL-centric full-stack app

- Static website

Reframe is a 0-LOC framework:
Reframe itself has no line of code and the
organization is j

well-polished starters that assemble with well-polished developer experience

It combines into a well polished assembly of do-one-thing-do-it-well

It features:
- Interactive Frontend (React, Vue)
- SSR
- RPC-like API
- Database & ORM

Such do-one-thing-do-it-well assemblies will eventually be as fully-featured
with
We will eventually
Reframe comes with starters that assembles libraries into a ready to use scaffold.
- ORM based full-stack app
- SQL based full-stack app
- Static website

on par with yet
Reframe is not fully-fledged yet but are exploring the following areas:
- Automatic Deployment [WIP]()
- Admin Panel [WIP]()
- CMS [WIP]()
