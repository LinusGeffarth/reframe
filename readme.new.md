# Reframe

Reframe allows you to **create web apps**, such as:
 -  - Create a
 - SQL-centric app with database, API, and interactive views (with the starter [Reframe Objection]())
 - [Reframe Prisma]() - Create An ORM-centric app with database, API, and interactive views (with the
 - [Reframe Static Website]() - A static website with modern technologies (with the)

We feature:
- Interactive views (with React, Vue, ...)
- Old-school backends with non-interactive dynamic HTML (with React/Vue/... as HTML template engine)
- Node.js Server (with Hapi, Koa, Express, ...)
- Database & ORM (with Objection.js, Prisma, ...)
- RPC-like API (with [Wildcard]())
- SSR (with [SSR Coin]())

And, we are exploring following areas:
- Automatic deployment - [WIP ticket #9]()
- Admin panel - [WIP ticket #1]()
- CMS - [WIP ticket #3]()

Reframe is what we call a *0-LOC framework*:
this repository has no source code
and [github.com/reframejs](https://github.com/reframejs) is merely a collection of:
 - **Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.**
   Each libary can be used independently of each other.
 - **Starters.**
   If you are not sure were to start, then the Reframe starters are here for you.
   If you already have an existic code base, you can cherry pick instead.

The benefits of such architecture are plenty:

**Freedom** -
You are entirely free to cherry pick as few, as many, and any do-one-thing-do-it-well library you want.
For example, among all Reframe libraries, you can choose to use only [Wildcard API](),
or you can choose a Reframe starter but with another ORM.
There is no lock-in;
you can replace any do-one-thing-well library with another one, or with your custom implementation.
For example you can use a Reframe starter and later replace React with the next cool thing (yes, we are [evaluating Svlete]() ;-)).
Or you can start using Reframe's auto-deploy library and later replace it with your custom deploy strategy.

**Robust tools** -
Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries tend to be more robust than frameworks.
They usually compete with many libraries that do the same thing
and they can survive a very long time resulting a hardened rock-solid tool.

**Robust framework** -
the day all the do-one-thing-well libraries we developed are replaced with
better libraries that do the same thing.
At that point

Fundammentally more robust architecture:
only do-one-thing-well libraries can be replaced with.
Reframe will become obsolete the day all do-one-thing-well we developed get .
But what's for sure: Monolithic frameworks are dead and 0-LOC frameworks are the future.
Everyone is happy :-).
If a new view library (we are evaluating Svelte btw.)
We can't wait to share do-one-thing-well libraries with other 0-LOC frameworks.
We forsee that Reframe will not be the only which is a good thing!
We want 
Resillient
 - Cooperation.
This makes each and ultimatively a more robust fundation for developing web apps.
and have a 
with and have 

libraries survive longer than frameworks and more robust.
If becomes obsolete and weak,
Reframe 
Eventually Reframe will be composed of only standard do-one-thing-do-it-well.
- harden 
over time we expect a better developer experience than monolithic frameworks.
- Future proof.
well-polished starters that assemble with well-polished developer experience
