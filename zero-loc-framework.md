## Zero-LOC Framework

We call a *Zero-LOC framework* (Zero Line-Of-Code framework),
a framework that consists only of:
- **Tools** -
  Where each tool is a do-one-thing-do-it-well tool
  that can be used individually and independently of other tools.
- **Starters** -
  A starter assembles tools into a well-polished scaffold.

A Zero-LOC framework allows you to develop as quickly as a monolithic framework,
such as Ruby on Rails,
but with a fundamental increase in freedom and robustness.

Freedom:
- **Cherry pick tools** -
  Each tool can be used individually and independently of each other &mdash; you can choose whatever tool you want.
- **No lock-in** -
  A Zero-LOC framework is only a collection of tools and starters &mdash; there is virtually no lock-in.
- **Scale** -
  Replace rapid-prototyping tools with entreprise-grade tools as you scale.

Robustness:
- **Robust tools** -
  Many do-one-thing-do-it-well tools
  survive a very long time (and usually out-survive frameworks that come and go) resulting into hardened and rock-solid tools.
- **Future-proof** -
  Being based on robust tools is not only a robust foundation but also a future-proof one:
  do-one-thing-do-it-well tools (and the Zero-LOC framework as a whole) can easily adapt to future technologies.
- **Growth & maintainability** -
  Being based on do-one-thing-do-it-well tools is a powerful separation of concerns.
  It is order of magnitudes easier to grow and maintain a Zero-LOC framework than a big monolith.
- **Framework collaboration** -
  We envision a future with
  many frameworks following the Zero-LOC philosophy and
  developing and sharing tools with each other.
  Leading to a vibrant and robust ecosystem.

Reframe's vision is to develop a Zero-LOC framework that is as feature-rich as Ruby on Rails.
