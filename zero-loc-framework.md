## Zero-LOC Framework

We call a *Zero-LOC framework* (Zero Line-of-Code Framework),
a framework that consists of:
- **Libraries** -
  Where each library is a do-one-thing-do-it-well library
  that can be used individually and independently of other libraries.
- **Starters** -
  Where starters assemble libraries into well-polished scaffolds.

A Zero-LOC framework allows you to develop as quickly as monolithic frameworks,
such as Ruby on Rails,
but with a fundamental increase in freedom and robustness.

Freedom:
- **Cherry pick libraries** -
  Each library can be used individually and independently of each other &mdash; you can choose whatever library you want.
- **No lock-in** -
  A Zero-LOC framework is only a collection of libraries and starters &mdash; there is virtually no lock-in.

Robustness:
- **Robust libraries** -
  Many do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
  survive a very long time (and out-survive frameworks that come and go) resulting into hardened and rock-solid tools.
- **Robust framework** -
  Being based on robust libraries is not only a robust foundation but also a future-proof one:
  do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries adapt more easily to future technologies.
- **Framework collaboration** -
  We envision a future with
  many frameworks following the Zero-LOC philosophy and
  sharing libraries with each other.
  Leading to a vibrant and robust ecosystem.

Reframe's goal is to develop a Zero-LOC framework that is as feature-rich as Ruby on Rails.
