## Zero-LOC Framework

We call a *Zero-LOC framework*, a framework that is merely a collection of:
- **Libraries** -
  Where each library is do-one-thing-do-it-well:
  it takes care of one thing and one thing only
  and can be used individually and independently of other libraries.
- **Starters** -
  A starter assembles libraries into a well-polished scaffold (aka boilerplate) for you to quickly get started.

A Zero-LOC framework allows you to develop as quickly as monolithic frameworks
(Ruby on Rails, Django, ...)
but with a fundamental increase in freedom and robustness.

Freedom:
- **Cherry pick libraries** -
  Each library can be used individually and independently of each other &mdash; you can choose which libraries you want to use.
- **No lock-in** -
  A Zero-LOC framework is only a collection of libraries and starters &mdash; there is virtually no lock-in.

Robustness:
- **Robust libraries** -
  Do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
  often survive a long time resulting into hardened and rock-solid tools.
- **Robust framework** -
  Being based on robust libraries is not only a robust foundation but also a future-proof one:
  do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries can more easily adapt to the tools of tomorrow.
- **Framework collaboration** -
  We hope our fellow framework authors to follow the Zero-LOC philosophy and
  we envision a future where frameworks share many libraries for a more vibrant and robust JavaScript ecosystem.

Reframe's goal is to develop a Zero-LOC framework that is as feature rich as Ruby on Rails.
